#' @section Process Definition: 
#' Random Walk (RW) with parameter \eqn{\gamma^2 \in {\rm I\!R}^{+}}{gamma in R^{+}}. This process is defined as:
#' \deqn{{X_t} = \sum\limits_{t = 1}^T {\gamma {Z_t}} }{X[t] = sum(gamma*Z[t])}
#' and is often called \emph{Rate Random Walk} in the engineering literature.
